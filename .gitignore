# Data and Models (if you want to keep them local and generate on server)
# In this case, the batch file suggests they are generated if missing
# but for a stable deploy it's often better to include them if they are static 
# or generate them during build.
# For now, I'll exclude the large model files and the data that can be regenerated.
